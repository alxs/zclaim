\begin{abstract}
    This thesis has been an incredible journey, taking more turns and allowing me to learn more than I could have ever expected.

    Right by my side in this journey were Fatemeh Shirazi and Alistair Stewart, my two supervisors at the Web3 Foundation, to whom I am immensely grateful for their guidance, help and support throughout the thesis.
    I am also grateful to everyone else at the foundation for their interest and eagerness to help, and for all absolutely enjoyable off-topic chats.
    You truly made me feel at home.
    
    I would also not be handing this in today if it were not for Petar Tsankov, who introduced me to the people at the Web3 Foundation and kindly offered to supervise me from the ETH side.
    I am grateful for his time, support and patience while he helped me figure it out, and for the vital directions and advice concerning the thesis structure with which he provided me.
    
    Moreover, I would like to extend my gratitude to Professor Martin Vechev for giving me the opportunity to write my thesis at the SRI Lab.
    
    Last but not least, I would like to thank my family, friends and flatmates for supporting me and brightening my mood during the most stressful times.
    If you are reading this: you are the best.

\begin{abstract}
Interoperability solutions for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies are hard to design: they must integrate with the unique privacy features of the underlying blockchain, itself often in active development, such as to trace specific payments in protocols designed to make payments untraceable.
The required specialised research and development effort have resulted in a lack of such projects, despite the dependence on centralised exchanges for cross-chain transfers being particularly problematic for privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies.

In this work, we present \zclaim, an adaptation of the framework for decentralised cross-chain exchanges \xclaim to the privacy-protecting cryp\-tocurrency Zcash.
This is to the author's knowledge the first project that succeeds in maintaining privacy in cross-chain transfers.

\zclaim integrates with the Sapling version of the Zcash protocol, implemented on a smart-contract capable issuing chain, in order to attain private cross-chain transfers.
We provide an abstract protocol specification, defining new transfer types that fit into the existing Sapling transaction structure along with zk-SNARKs allowing protocol participants to prove statements about Zcash transactions in zero knowledge on the issuing chain.
